You can find some basic useful lines from my .bashrc here.
My goal was to help beginners in Linux shell getting started.

First you need to install Git, RVM, Ruby and Rails to use these properly.

Don't overwrite your .bashrc with these lines. It's better to keep them separately or appending your existing file.
Only extra lines here, please check documentation first before using them.
